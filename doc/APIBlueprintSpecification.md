## 1. Introduction [Introduction]
This documents is full specification of [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io)'s API Blueprint Language. API Blueprint Language is a domain-specific language in which you can describe any modern [REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com) or [Hypermedia]() API. It was built to **design** and **create** **API wireframes** as well as **documentation**.

While the language is simple enough to be used by anybody with the elementary programming skills it is recommended to go through [Tutorial](http://apiary.io/blueprint) first before continuing with the full specification.

Note that it is not in scope of this document to discuss any of the Apiary.io tools such as [Mock Server](http://apiary.io), [Proxy](http://apiary.io) or others. However some of them may be mentioned by this document.

---

## 2. API Blueprint Language [Language]
API Blueprint Language is essentially a superset of John Gruber's [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), where some constructs have **strictly defined meaning**. It inherits few major [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown) and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) features.

Before you will proceed with this document please make yourself familiar with the basic [Markdown Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) as well as with the Metadata and Automatic Cross-References sections of [MultiMarkdown Syntax](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#multimarkdown-syntax-guide) and GitHub Flavored Markdown's [newlines & fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

The **API Blueprint Language** is using selected **Markdown constructs**, such as headers, lists or pre-formatted blocks, to **define** and **describe** your **API**. These constructs are usually recognized by reserved names, expected formatting and / or by their specific locations.

In addition to usual Markdown elements you can use HTML-style **comments** (`<!--` & `-->`) to comment out a block of blueprint or add additional notes.

---

## 3. API Blueprint Document [Document]
API Blueprint Document is where you describe, explain and define the interface. 

The document itself is divided into several logical sections forming **API Blueprint Document Structure**.

### 3.1. Sections [Sections]
A section represents a logical unit of your API Blueprint. For example an API overview, resource definition or a resource discussion.

Section are recognized by a **reserved section name** or an **URI template** in **Markdown header**. Only **atx-style** headers  (e.g. `# Header`) are considered.

Each sections has strictly defined name, meaning and content. Anything between a Section Markdown header and another such a header at the same level is considered to be a section. This implies you **must avoid** using reserved section names â€“ **keywords** in other Markdown headers.

### 3.2. Reserved Section Names [ReservedSectionNames]
Reserved sections and their meanings in [API Blueprint Document Structure](DocumentStructure). Note that some section names can contain variable components such as identifiers or other modifiers. See relevant section's entry to find out more about how section name is built.

Currently reserved keywords are:

* **Request**
* **Response**
* **Headers**
* **Parameters**
* **Body**
* **Schema**
* \+ HTTP method names
* \+ URIs

### 3.3. Nested sections [NestedSections]
Sections can be nested. To nest a section in another section simply **increase** its atx-style **header level**.

Example:

	# Section A
	... Section A content ...

	## Nested Section of Section A
	... Nested Section content ...

	# Section B
	... Section B content...

What section can be nested and where depends on the actual section as described in relevant [API Blueprint Document Structure](DocumentStructure) section's entry.

Note that parser **strictly controls nesting** (header levels).

### 3.4. Other Markdown headers [OtherMarkdownHeaders]
You are free to use any Markdown header of your liking anywhere as long as it does not clash with [Reserved Section Names](ReservedSectionNames). It is considered a good practice to keep your own header level nested to your actual section.

### 3.5. Special Sections [SpecialSections]
There are **two additional** sections of a Blueprint Document to sections represented by a [Reserved Name Sections][Sections]: A [Metadata Section][MetadataSection] and the [API Name & Overview][APINameOverviewSection]. These are discussed in the [API Blueprint Document Structure][DocumentStructure]

---

## 4. API Blueprint Document Structure [DocumentStructure]
Bellow you will find description of every section of the API Blueprint Document. Note that all sections but [API Name & Overview][APINameOverviewSection] section are optional. That is your API Blueprint Document **must** contain at least the API Name. However the document should contain one or more [Resource][ResourceSection] Section.

An example of a possible API Blueprint Document layout:

	Metadata: ...

	# API Name
	...
	# Group 1
	...
	## Resource 1.1
	...
	### Parameters
	...
	### Request
	...
	### Response
	...
	## Resource 1.2
	...
	### Response
	...
	# Group 2
	...
	## Resource 2.1
	...

### 4.1. Metadata Section [MetadataSection]
**Optional**. Section containing API metadata.

This section is **recognized** as [MultiMarkdown' Metadata](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/blob/master/Documentation/MultiMarkdown%20User%27s%20Guide.md#metadata). It starts from the beginning of the document and ends with a first Markdown header.

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

#### Supported Metadata
* **`Host` (or `HOST`)** *(optional)* ... API server hostname.
* **`Format`** *(optional)* ... API Blueprint version. Leave blank for legacy format. Use `1A` for actual version.

Example:

	Host: http://blog.acme.com
	Format: 1A

### 4.2. API Name & Overview Section [APINameOverviewSection]
**Required**. Name of the API in the form of a Markdown header.

This section is **recognized** as the **first** Markdown header in your document its name is considered to be your **API name**.

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent the API Overview.

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	# My API Name

	-- or --

	# Basic ACME Blog API
	Welcome to the **ACME Blog** API. This API provides access to the **ACME Blog** service.

### 4.3. Resource Section [ResourceSection]
**Optional**. Definition of exactly *one* API [Resource](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-resource). Your blueprint document can contain multiple sections for the same resource - URI as long as their HTTP methods differ.

This section is **recognized** by an [RFC 6570 URI template](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) written in an atx-style Markdown header. Optionally the header can contain one leading [HTTP Request Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods).

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent Resource description.

This section **must include** at least one [Response Section][ResourceResponseSection] **or**, if no **HTTP Request Method** is specified, this section **must include** at least one [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection].

In addition to any mandatory nested sections this section **may include** following additional nested sections:
 
* [Parameters Section][ResourceParametersSection]
* [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection],  if **no** HTTP Request Method is specified
* [Request Section][ResourceRequestSection], if a HTTP Request Method is specified
* [Response Section][ResourceResponseSection], if a HTTP Request Method is specified
* [Headers Section][ResourceHeadersSection]

Example:

	# PUT /posts

	-- or --

	# GET /posts{/id}

	-- or --

	# /posts

#### 4.3.1. Parameters Section [ResourceParametersSection]
**Optional**. Description of [Resource Section][ResourceSection]'s URI parameters. Content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Parameters"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header. This section must be nested under an [Resource Section][ResourceSection].

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent general Resource URI parameter description. The rest of this section is formatted as follows:

	+ <parameter name> [= <default value>] [<type> [,(required | optional)]] ... Markdown-formatted content

Where:

* `<parameter name>` is a parameter name as written in [Resource Section][ResourceSection]'s URI (e.g. "id").
* `<default value>` is **optional** parameter default or example value (e.g. 1234).
* `<type>` is **optional** parameter type as expected by your API (e.g. "number").
* `required` is **optional** specifier of a required parameter
* `optional` is **optional** specifier of a optional parameter

This section does not have to enumerate every URI parameter. It **should not** however contain parameter that is not specified in URI.

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	# GET /posts{/id}
	## Parameters
	+ id ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

	+ id = 1234 ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

	+ id (number) ... Id of a post.

	-- or --

	+ id = 1234 (number) ... Id of a post.

Note that parameters description is used for documentation purposes only.

#### 4.3.2. Method Section [ResourceMethodSection]
**Required** if there is no HTTP method specified in [Resource Section][ResourceSection]'s header. **Illegal** otherwise. [HTTP Request Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) available for this Resource.

This section is **recognized** by one of the [HTTP Request Methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) written in capitals as an atx-style Markdown header.

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent this Resource method description.

This section **must include** at least one [Response Section][ResourceResponseSection]. In addition to mandatory nested section this section **may include** following additional nested sections:
 
* [Parameters Section][ResourceParametersSection]
* [Request Section][ResourceRequestSection], if a HTTP Request Method is specified
* [Response Section][ResourceResponseSection], if a HTTP Request Method is specified
* [Headers Section][ResourceHeadersSection]

One [Resource Section][ResourceSection] can contain **one or more different** Method Sections.

Example:

	# /posts{/id}
	## Parameters
	...

	## GET
	Retrieves a **ACME Blog** posts.
	...

	## PUT
	...

#### 4.3.3. Request Section [ResourceRequestSection]
**Optional**. Description of exactly *one* [HTTP request](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-request).

This section is **recognized** by the **"Request"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header. The **"Request"** can be followed by an arbitrary string representing user identifier of this request. This identifier **must not** be enclosed in brackets. In case HTTP body is specified the **"Request"** keyword (and possible identifier) should be followed by HTTP Body [Media Type (MIME type)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type).

Full Request section header syntax is as follows:

	# Request [<identifier>] [(<Media Type>)]

This section is a specific type of [Payload][Payloads] carried by this request. See [Payloads Documentation][Payloads] for details on how to specify the content of this section.

One [Resource Section][ResourceSection] or [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection] can contain **one or more different** (that is with different identifier) Request Sections.

Example:

	# Request (text/plain)
		Hello World

	-- or --

	# Request Create Blog Post (application/json)
	    { "message" : "Hello World." }

#### 4.3.4. Response Section [ResourceResponseSection]
**Required**. Description of exactly *one* [HTTP response](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/#def-http-response).

This section is **recognized** by the **"Response"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header followed by a [HTTP Status code](http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html). In case HTTP body is specified the **"Response"** keyword should be followed by HTTP Body [Media Type (MIME type)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type).

Full Response section header syntax is as follows:

	# Response <Status Code> [(<Media Type>)]

This section **must** be nested under a [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection] unless a HTTP method is specified in the [Resource Section][ResourceSection]'s header. In that case this section must be nested under the [Resource Section][ResourceSection].

This section is a specific type of [Payload][Payloads] carried by this response. See [Payload Documentation][Payloads] for details on how to specify the content of this section.

One [Resource Section][ResourceSection] or [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection] can contain **one or more different** (that is with different HTTP Status code) Response Sections.

Example:

	# Response 201 (application/json)
		{ "message" : "created" }

#### 4.3.5. Headers Section [ResourceHeadersSection]
**Optional**. Description HTTP Headers parameters. Content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Headers"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header. Optionally the **"Headers"** keyword can be preceded by either `Response` or `Request` header keyword.

Full Header section header syntax is as follows:

	# [Request [<identifier>] | Response <status code>] Headers

This section must be nested under one of the following sections:

* [Resource Section][ResourceSection]
* [Method Section][ResourceMethodSection]

Based on where is this sections is nested the headers are expected or send as follows:

* **Resource Section**: Headers are expected and/or send with **every** request and/or response on this **Resource's URI**.
* **Method Section**: Headers are expected and/or send with **every** request and/or response with specific **method and Resource's URI**.

Based on keywords preceding the **"Headers"** keyword the headers are expected or send as follows:

* **Request** keyword: Headers are expected only with requests.
* **Response** keyword: Headers are send only with responses.

The section is formatted as an Markdown's [Pre-formatted code blocks](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode) with following syntax:

	<HTTP header name>: <value>

One HTTP header per line.

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	# Headers
	    Accept-Charset: utf-8
	    Connection: keep-alive

	# Request Headers
	    Accept-Charset: utf-8
	    Connection: keep-alive

	# Response 201 Headers
		 X-ACME-API-Version: 42


### 4.4. Grouping resources [ResourceGroups]
Resource sections can be grouped together. For example by a common task such as handling payments, shopping cart manipulation, blog post management or user management.

To group resources simply [nest][NestedSections] your resource section(s) under an atx-style Markdown header of a group's name.

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent group description.

Group **must include** at least one [Resource Section][ResourceSection].

Example:

	# Blog Posts
	Resources in this groups are related to **ACME Blog** posts.

	## GET /posts{/id}
		...

	## PUT /posts
		...

	# Authors
	## GET /authors
		...

	# Comments
		...

---

## 5. Payloads [Payloads]
An payload is essentially data expected in a HTTP request or send in a HTTP response. Payload consists of meta information in form of HTTP headers and content received or send in a HTTP body. Furthermore API Blueprint Payload can include its description as well as discussion of its parameters.

Note that the term "payload" (excluding its description) as used in this document is technically a subset of [HTTP Payload](http://www.w3.org/TR/di-gloss/). There might be additional metadata (HTTP headers) specified outside of the scope of the payload that can form up the final HTTP Payload.

A Payload has **always** its Media Type associated. Payload's Media type represents a metadata that is always received or send in form of an HTTP `Content-Type` header.

Payload section header syntax is follows:

	# <Payload Identifier> (<Media Type>)

Payload is formed from following **optional** *nested* sections: 

* [Headers Section][PayloadHeadersSection]
* [Parameters Section][PayloadParametersSection]
* [Body Section][PayloadBodySection]
* [Schema Section][PayloadSchemaSection]

If **no section** is specified content of the payload section is treated as a [Body Section][PayloadBodySection].

Example:

	# MyPayload (application/json)
	## Headers
		X-My-Payload-Size: 42

	## Parameters
	+ message ... A message.

	## Body
		{ ... }

	## Schema
		{ ... }


### 5.1. Headers Section [PayloadHeadersSection]
**Optional**. Specifies the metadata in form of HTTP headers to be received or send with the payload. Content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Headers"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header. No further keywords or modifiers are expected.

See to [Resource Headers Section][ResourceHeadersSection] for this section's syntax definition.

Example:

	# MyPayload (application/json)
	## Headers
		X-My-Payload-Size: 42

### 5.2. Parameters Section [PayloadParametersSection]
**Optional** for **application/json** media type. Description of [Payload][Payloads]'s parameters. Content of this section is subject to additional formatting.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Parameters"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header.

This section can contain **further Markdown-formatted content**. If a content is provided it is considered to represent general payload parameters description. The rest of this section is formatted as follows:

	+ <parameter name> [= <default value>] [<type> [,(required | optional)]] ... Markdown-formatted content


Where `<parameter name>` is name of a [body][PayloadBodySection] top-level field. To access the elements of an array and to access the fields of a subdocument use [MongoDB Dot Notation](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/document/#dot-notation).

See Resource [Parameters Section][ResourceParametersSection] for further details.

Example:

	# MyPayload (application/json)
	## Headers
		X-My-Payload-Size: 42

	## Parameters
		+ message (string) ... A message from **ACME Blog** API.

### 5.3. Body Section [PayloadBodySection]
**Optional**. Specifies content of the payload received or send in the form of HTTP body.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Body"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header.

This section represents an API Blueprint Document [Asset][DocumentAssets].

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

Example:

	# MyPayload (application/json)
	## Headers
		X-My-Payload-Size: 42

	## Parameters
		+ message (string) ... A message from **ACME Blog** API.

	## Body
		{ "message" : "Hello World." }

### 5.4. Schema Section [PayloadSchemaSection]
**Optional**. Where applicable specifies a schema used to validate this payload's body content.

This section is **recognized** by the **"Schema"** reserved **keyword** written in an atx-style Markdown header.

This section represents an API Blueprint Document [Asset][DocumentAssets].

This section **does not include** any **other sections**.

---

## 6. Assets [DocumentAssets]
An API Blueprint Document Asset is simply a resource (not to be confused with API Resource) â€“ a piece data used in [payloads][Payloads].

### 6.1. Inline Asset [InlineDocumentAsset]
In its simplest form an asset is essentially a Markdown's [Pre-formatted code blocks](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#precode). The sole content of this block is considered to represent the Asset's data.

Example:

	# Asset Name
		{ "message" : "Hello World." }
